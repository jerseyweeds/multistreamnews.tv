# LLM Development Notes - MultiStreamNews.TV

This file serves as long-term knowledge for AI assistants working on this project, documenting key decisions, architectural choices, and change history.

## Project Architecture & Design Decisions

### 1. Single File Architecture
- **Decision**: Keep everything in one HTML file (index.html)
- **Rationale**: Simplicity, easy deployment, no build process, single point of truth
- **Impact**: All CSS, JavaScript, and HTML in one file for easy hosting and maintenance
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages support with CNAME configuration

### 2. Built-in vs External Data Sources
- **Decision**: Use built-in JavaScript arrays for news channels instead of external files
- **Rationale**: Eliminated dependency on external files, improved reliability, faster loading
- **Previous Issue**: Originally used external networks.txt file which caused loading issues
- **Current State**: All news channels are hardcoded in the `newsChannels` array
- **Backend Support**: Optional Python scripts available for advanced stream parsing and network management

### 3. Touch Device Detection Strategy
- **Challenge**: Hide drag-and-drop and manual input only on true mobile devices, not small screens
- **Solution**: Multi-layered detection approach:
  - CSS `@media (pointer: coarse)` for pointer type detection
  - JavaScript `isTouchDevice()` function checking multiple touch APIs
  - Combined approach using `.touch-device` class applied to body
- **Key Insight**: Screen size â‰  device type. Small desktop windows should retain full functionality

### 4. Video Management Philosophy
- **Maximize/Restore Logic**: Videos continue playing without interruption when maximized/restored
- **Rationale**: User experience - no need to restart video playback
- **Implementation**: Only modify CSS classes and positioning, never reload iframes

### 6. Backend Scanner System Architecture
- **Purpose**: Automated detection and monitoring of live YouTube news streams
- **Design Philosophy**: Multiple detection methods for robust stream identification
- **Shell Script Manager**: Single entry point (`live_stream_manager.sh`) for all operations
- **Network Configuration**: Unified `network_list.txt` with tab-separated values
- **Parsing Logic**: Smart parsing that skips headers and empty lines across all scripts
- **Result Management**: Timestamped JSON outputs with comprehensive metadata
- **Automation Support**: Continuous monitoring, scheduled scans, and background processes
- **Color Coding**: 
  - Green: Success
  - Orange: Duplicates  
  - Red: Errors
  - Yellow: Warnings/Mixed issues
- **Auto-hide**: 4-second timeout for most notifications
- **Non-blocking**: Positioned to not interfere with workflow
