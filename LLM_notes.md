# LLM Development Notes - MultiStreamNews.TV

This file serves as long-term knowledge for AI assistants working on this project, documenting key decisions, architectural choices, and change history.

## Project Architecture & Design Decisions

### 1. Single File Architecture
- **Decision**: Keep everything in one HTML file (index.html)
- **Rationale**: Simplicity, easy deployment, no build process, single point of truth
- **Impact**: All CSS, JavaScript, and HTML in one file for easy hosting and maintenance
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages support with CNAME configuration

### 2. Built-in vs External Data Sources
- **Decision**: Use built-in JavaScript arrays for news channels instead of external files
- **Rationale**: Eliminated dependency on external files, improved reliability, faster loading
- **Previous Issue**: Originally used external networks.txt file which caused loading issues
- **Current State**: All news channels are hardcoded in the `newsChannels` array
- **Backend Support**: Optional Python scripts available for advanced stream parsing and network management

### 3. Touch Device Detection Strategy
- **Challenge**: Hide drag-and-drop and manual input only on true mobile devices, not small screens
- **Solution**: Multi-layered detection approach:
  - CSS `@media (pointer: coarse)` for pointer type detection
  - JavaScript `isTouchDevice()` function checking multiple touch APIs
  - Combined approach using `.touch-device` class applied to body
- **Key Insight**: Screen size ≠ device type. Small desktop windows should retain full functionality

### 4. Video Management Philosophy
- **Maximize/Restore Logic**: Videos continue playing without interruption when maximized/restored
- **Rationale**: User experience - no need to restart video playback
- **Implementation**: Only modify CSS classes and positioning, never reload iframes

### 6. Backend Scanner System Architecture
- **Purpose**: Automated detection and monitoring of live YouTube news streams
- **Design Philosophy**: Multiple detection methods for robust stream identification
- **Shell Script Manager**: Single entry point (`live_stream_manager.sh`) for all operations
- **Network Configuration**: Unified `network_list.txt` with tab-separated values
- **Parsing Logic**: Smart parsing that skips headers and empty lines across all scripts
- **Result Management**: Timestamped JSON outputs with comprehensive metadata
- **Automation Support**: Continuous monitoring, scheduled scans, and background processes
- **Color Coding**: 
  - Green: Success
  - Orange: Duplicates  
  - Red: Errors
  - Yellow: Warnings/Mixed issues
- **Auto-hide**: 4-second timeout for most notifications
- **Non-blocking**: Positioned to not interfere with workflow

## Change History & Lessons Learned

  - Confirmation dialog to prevent accidental bulk loading
  - Smart duplicate detection within news channels array
  - Progress feedback during bulk loading
  - Detailed results reporting (added/duplicate/failed counts)
  - Small delays between additions to prevent browser overload
- **Design**: Sparkle emoji (✨) with gradient styling and hover effects
- **Location**: Below italicized text in news channels section

### UI/UX Evolution

#### Header Coffee Button
- **Desktop**: Shows "Like this? Buy me a coffee ;-)"
- **Mobile**: Shows "Buy me a coffee" (cleaner, more direct)
- **Latest Update**: Ensured mobile version says full phrase instead of just "Coffee"
- **Payment Options**: PayPal, Apple Pay (with fallback), and Venmo (June 30, 2025)

#### Video Window Controls
- **Style**: macOS-inspired traffic light buttons (red, yellow, green)
- **Behavior**: 
  - Red: Close window
  - Yellow: Minimize/restore content
  - Green: Maximize/restore to full width
- **Key Feature**: Maximized videos move to top but don't restart playback

#### Drag-and-Drop Zones
- **Evolution**: From dedicated drop zone to entire page as drop target
- **Current**: Both drag zone and video container accept drops
- **Feedback**: Visual animations and notifications for all drop events

## Technical Implementation Notes

### CSS Architecture
- **Framework**: Tailwind CSS via CDN
- **Custom Styles**: Minimal custom CSS in `<style>` tag
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first with specific breakpoints (640px, 768px, 1024px, 1280px)
- **Grid System**: CSS Grid for video layout with automatic column adjustment

### JavaScript Patterns
- **Event Handling**: Comprehensive event delegation for dynamic content
- **Async Operations**: Proper async/await for video loading and title fetching
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for API failures
- **Local Storage**: Persistent session management for video URLs

### API Integration
- **YouTube oEmbed**: For fetching video titles
- **QR Code Generation**: External API for donation QR codes
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics (GA4) integration

## Common Issues & Solutions

### 1. Drag-and-Drop Browser Compatibility
- **Issue**: Different browsers handle drag events differently
- **Solution**: Multi-method URL extraction from drag events
- **Methods**: text/uri-list, text/plain, text/html parsing, HTML link extraction

### 2. YouTube URL Validation
- **Patterns**: Support both youtube.com/watch?v= and youtu.be/ formats
- **Validation**: Video ID must be exactly 11 characters
- **Edge Cases**: Handle URLs with additional parameters gracefully

### 3. Mobile Safari Quirks
- **Touch Detection**: Use multiple methods due to inconsistent touch API support
- **Video Autoplay**: Muted autoplay works better across iOS versions
- **Layout**: Careful handling of viewport units on mobile Safari

### 4. Backend Integration Considerations
- **Python Scripts**: Available for advanced stream parsing and network management
- **CORS Issues**: Browser limitations prevent direct YouTube page access
- **Proxy Solutions**: Server-side proxy may be needed for advanced YouTube data extraction
- **API Rate Limits**: YouTube oEmbed API has usage limits that should be respected

## Code Quality Guidelines

### 1. Maintainability
- **Comments**: Comprehensive section headers and function documentation
- **Structure**: Logical code organization with clear separation of concerns
- **Consistency**: Uniform naming conventions and coding style

### 2. Performance
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Only essential external resources (Tailwind CDN)
- **Efficient DOM**: Minimize DOM queries and manipulation
- **Memory Management**: Proper event listener cleanup and object references

### 3. User Experience
- **Feedback**: Always provide user feedback for actions
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Add hotkeys for common actions
2. **Video Synchronization**: Option to sync playback across videos
3. **Custom Layouts**: Saved layout presets
4. **Extended Platform Support**: Other video platforms beyond YouTube
5. **PWA Features**: Offline functionality and installation
6. **Live Stream Detection**: Advanced YouTube live stream identification and monitoring
7. **Backend API Integration**: Enhanced data fetching and stream management
8. **Advanced Analytics**: User behavior tracking and video engagement metrics

### Architecture Decisions to Maintain
1. **Single File**: Keep everything in one HTML file for core functionality
2. **Built-in Data**: Avoid external data dependencies for primary features
3. **Touch-First**: Mobile-optimized design with desktop enhancement
4. **Non-breaking Updates**: Always maintain backward compatibility
5. **Optional Backend**: Keep backend features optional and non-blocking
